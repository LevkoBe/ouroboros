    "mainText": "We are a grassroots collective based in the south of Ukraine, specifically in Mykolaiv and Kherson, born out of urgency and sustained by care. When the full-scale invasion began, many of us were artists, businesspeople and organizers — but the war pushed us to come together in new ways. We are a multinational team. Our core members come both from the US and from Ukraine.",

When the full-scale invasion began, many of us were artists, businesspeople and organizers — but the war pushed us to come together in new ways. We are a multinational team. Our core members come both from the US and from Ukraine.",
      "part2": "Oro, one of the founders of the organisation, was a professional photographer, artist and activist in the US before 2022 when he moved to Ukraine. He was drawn here not only by personal sentiment, as several of his close friends had already lived here or volunteered, but also by an innate sense of justice and duty. At first, he volunteered all over Ukraine, documenting war crimes, procuring and delivering humanitarian aid to front-line communities and supporting various military units. He has witnessed firsthand the horrors of russian aggression. He has worked in the east and south with several international organizations and has been living and volunteering in Ukraine for three years now.",
      "part3": "Lyn, co-founder of the organization, a native Ukrainian and artist, first attended various volunteer initiatives in Lviv. Her desire to do and see more led her to humanitarian actions in the frontline areas in eastern Ukraine, and later to the south after meeting Oro at a friend’s memorial. Lyn is a talented multi-disciplinary artist, and recognizes the healing power of the arts in building community and healing traumas inflicted by war.",
      "part4": "At the end of 2024, Oro and Lyn founded their organization — the Ouroboros Charitable Foundation. While humanitarian aid remains an important part of their work, the foundation now focuses on long-term needs that are just as urgent: supporting the psychological well-being of people affected by war, maintaining disaster readiness, and providing aid to vulnerable populations.",
      "part5": "Sadly, every part of Ukraine continues to bear the deep trauma of conflict. Ouroboros has several socially vital projects, such as providing safe shelter and relocation for internally displaced people from high-risk areas of the Kherson region, helping people integrate into new communities, and developing initiatives to revitalize local economies."

      "description": "We work in the south of Ukraine, focusing on frontline and war-affected areas of the Mykolaiv and Kherson regions. Our team delivers essential supplies—food, hygiene items, and medical aid—to vulnerable residents, often under daily shelling. Together with local volunteers, we respond quickly to urgent needs on the ground.\nThanks to strong partnerships with international donors, we receive and distribute humanitarian aid directly where it’s needed most. Our trusted network, built on transparency and local knowledge, allows us to coordinate efficiently across both regions. In our first six months, we reached over 5,000 people—and we continue regular missions to Kherson, where aid remains critically needed."

      "description": "Conflict doesn’t only affect people—it leaves behind thousands of abandoned animals, too. In frontline areas, especially parts of Kherson and Mykolaiv, the street animal population continues to grow, with many cats and dogs left behind by displaced or deceased owners. Without sterilization or regular care, the situation worsens daily.\nWe work with local animal welfare volunteers who courageously care for these animals despite the risks and scarce resources. Through our partnerships and donations, we regularly deliver food and basic supplies to help sustain their efforts. We also support two animal shelters—one in the Mykolaiv region and one in Kherson—providing ongoing assistance to keep their operations running safely and humanely."

      "description": "Healing from war takes more than humanitarian aid—it takes community, creativity, and care. That’s why we support the development and operation of local social and creative centers in frontline towns and villages. With help from our international partners and donors, we provide financial and material support to equip these spaces with everything they need—from basic furnishings to art materials and educational supplies.\nThese centers offer safe spaces for people to gather, decompress, and reconnect. We organize regular events, workshops, and art-based activities aimed at improving mental well-being, supporting emotional recovery, and encouraging social reintegration—especially for children and families living under the constant weight of war.\nBy working closely with local organizers and residents, we ensure these centers reflect the needs of the communities they serve, while creating lasting infrastructure for care and resilience."
