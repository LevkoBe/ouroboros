When the full-scale invasion began, many of us were artists, businesspeople and organizers — but the war pushed us to come together in new ways. We are a multinational team. Our core members come both from the US and from Ukraine.",

Our core members come both from the US and from Ukraine.",
      "part2": "Oro, one of the founders of the organisation, was a professional photographer, artist and activist in the US before 2022 when he moved to Ukraine. He was drawn here not only by personal sentiment, as several of his close friends had already lived here or volunteered, but also by an innate sense of justice and duty. At first, he volunteered all over Ukraine, documenting war crimes, procuring and delivering humanitarian aid to front-line communities and supporting various military units. He has witnessed firsthand the horrors of russian aggression. He has worked in the east and south with several international organizations and has been living and volunteering in Ukraine for three years now.",
      "part3": "Lyn, co-founder of the organization, a native Ukrainian and artist, first attended various volunteer initiatives in Lviv. Her desire to do and see more led her to humanitarian actions in the frontline areas in eastern Ukraine, and later to the south after meeting Oro at a friend’s memorial. Lyn is a talented multi-disciplinary artist, and recognizes the healing power of the arts in building community and healing traumas inflicted by war.",
      "part4": "At the end of 2024, Oro and Lyn founded their organization — the Ouroboros Charitable Foundation. While humanitarian aid remains an important part of their work, the foundation now focuses on long-term needs that are just as urgent: supporting the psychological well-being of people affected by war, maintaining disaster readiness, and providing aid to vulnerable populations.",
      "part5": "Sadly, every part of Ukraine continues to bear the deep trauma of conflict. Ouroboros has several socially vital projects, such as providing safe shelter and relocation for internally displaced people from high-risk areas of the Kherson region, helping people integrate into new communities, and developing initiatives to revitalize local economies."

Our team delivers essential supplies—food, hygiene items, and medical aid—to vulnerable residents, often under daily shelling. Together with local volunteers, we respond quickly to urgent needs on the ground.\nThanks to strong partnerships with international donors, we receive and distribute humanitarian aid directly where it’s needed most. Our trusted network, built on transparency and local knowledge, allows us to coordinate efficiently across both regions. In our first six months, we reached over 5,000 people—and we continue regular missions to Kherson, where aid remains critically needed."

      "description": "Conflict doesn’t only affect people—it leaves behind thousands of abandoned animals, too. In frontline areas, especially parts of Kherson and Mykolaiv, the street animal population continues to grow, with many cats and dogs left behind by displaced or deceased owners. Without sterilization or regular care, the situation worsens daily.\nWe work with local animal welfare volunteers who courageously care for these animals despite the risks and scarce resources. Through our partnerships and donations, we regularly deliver food and basic supplies to help sustain their efforts. We also support two animal shelters—one in the Mykolaiv region and one in Kherson—providing ongoing assistance to keep their operations running safely and humanely."

That’s why we support the development and operation of local social and creative centers in frontline towns and villages. With help from our international partners and donors, we provide financial and material support to equip these spaces with everything they need—from basic furnishings to art materials and educational supplies.\nThese centers offer safe spaces for people to gather, decompress, and reconnect. We organize regular events, workshops, and art-based activities aimed at improving mental well-being, supporting emotional recovery, and encouraging social reintegration—especially for children and families living under the constant weight of war.\nBy working closely with local organizers and residents, we ensure these centers reflect the needs of the communities they serve, while creating lasting infrastructure for care and resilience."

But even in the midst of destruction, people still seek connection, meaning, and hope. That’s why we’re creating the Creative & Healing Center—a safe, welcoming space where individuals affected by war can come together to recover, grow, and reimagine their lives through shared creativity and care.\nThis future center will serve displaced families, war survivors, veterans, young people, and local residents who carry the weight of trauma and uncertainty. It will offer:\nArt therapy and creative workshops led by local and visiting artists\n- Community events and collaborative projects that foster connection and purpose\n- A gallery and performance space to share what’s created with the wider world\n- A quiet room and recreational zones for rest and reflection\n- A small co-working and volunteer hub to build local initiatives\n- An inclusive, affordable café which will provide tasty food and employment opportunities for the people we serve.\nWhether someone has fled home, lost loved ones, or is simply searching for stability, this center will provide tools for emotional healing and opportunities for cultural expression. It will also become a vital platform for building solidarity between displaced and local communities—through art, storytelling, and action.\nThis is a long-term vision rooted in grassroots experience, real relationships, and the resilience we witness every day.\nWith your support, we can turn this vision into a living, breathing reality."

        "description": "A vision for safe, sustainable homes and a new beginning—built together.\nAs the war in Ukraine continues, thousands of families remain displaced, many trapped in dangerous zones with nowhere to go. At the same time, Ukraine’s rural regions hold incredible potential: abandoned villages, existing homes, and open land—resources that can be restored and repurposed to provide not just shelter, but a future.\nOur Eco-Settlement Project aims to do just that.\nWe will work to transform these forgotten places into vibrant, eco-friendly communities where displaced families can find stability, purpose, and hope. The settlements will combine free housing, community-driven renovation efforts, and job opportunities in sustainable farming, crafts, and local enterprise.\nThrough a mix of renovated village homes and modular shelters, we will provide immediate and long-term housing to those most in need—especially families, veterans, and people who’ve lost everything. Together with volunteers and residents, we’ll rebuild these spaces through traditional Ukrainian “toloka” (collective labor), reconnecting people not only with land, but with one another.\nEach settlement will also include:\n- Cultural and co-working spaces for education, skill-building, and healing\n- Local economic initiatives, from eco-agriculture to small-scale tourism\n- Recreational zones and safe environments for children and families\n- Inclusive infrastructure for veterans, the elderly, and those with disabilities\nIn time, these communities will become self-sustaining eco-villages—places where displaced people aren’t just surviving, but growing, leading, and shaping their own futures. They will serve as models for post-war recovery rooted in sustainability, dignity, and collective care.\nBy investing in this project, you help us turn loss into life. Abandonment into belonging.\nLet’s build something lasting—together."

Many animals have been abandoned or injured due to the war, and local volunteers—fearless and devoted—struggle to care for them with limited resources.  \n## Project Goals:  \n- Purchase quality pet food from local producers to support both street animals and the local economy.  \n- Provide mobility aids such as wheelchairs for wounded dogs who have lost or injured their legs in conflict zones.  \n- Support local shelters and volunteer groups feeding and caring for street animals daily.  \n## Estimated Budget:  \n**$2,000 USD**  \nThis covers regular pet food deliveries and the purchase and shipping of specialized wheelchairs for disabled dogs in Kherson.  \n## Project Timeline:  \nAll purchases and deliveries will be completed within one month after the funding goal is reached.  \n### If the project cannot be fully realized or there are leftover funds:  \nRemaining funds will be redirected to other urgent animal welfare and humanitarian aid initiatives for people from the frontline zones within our foundation’s work in the south of Ukraine.  \n## Important Information for Donors:  \n*By donating to this project, you agree that your contribution may be reallocated to other related projects if this campaign concludes, becomes inactive, or cannot proceed.*  \n**Donations are non-refundable.**  \n**Help us care for the forgotten paws of Kherson and Mykolaiv — support the street animals today!**  \n## SUPPORT THE PROJECT\n"
