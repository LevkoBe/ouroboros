    "mainText": "We are a grassroots collective based in the south of Ukraine, specifically in Mykolaiv and Kherson, born out of urgency and sustained by care. When the full-scale invasion began, many of us were artists, businesspeople and organizers — but the war pushed us to come together in new ways. We are a multinational team. Our core members come both from the US and from Ukraine.",

When the full-scale invasion began, many of us were artists, businesspeople and organizers — but the war pushed us to come together in new ways. We are a multinational team. Our core members come both from the US and from Ukraine.",
      "part2": "Oro, one of the founders of the organisation, was a professional photographer, artist and activist in the US before 2022 when he moved to Ukraine. He was drawn here not only by personal sentiment, as several of his close friends had already lived here or volunteered, but also by an innate sense of justice and duty. At first, he volunteered all over Ukraine, documenting war crimes, procuring and delivering humanitarian aid to front-line communities and supporting various military units. He has witnessed firsthand the horrors of russian aggression. He has worked in the east and south with several international organizations and has been living and volunteering in Ukraine for three years now.",
      "part3": "Lyn, co-founder of the organization, a native Ukrainian and artist, first attended various volunteer initiatives in Lviv. Her desire to do and see more led her to humanitarian actions in the frontline areas in eastern Ukraine, and later to the south after meeting Oro at a friend’s memorial. Lyn is a talented multi-disciplinary artist, and recognizes the healing power of the arts in building community and healing traumas inflicted by war.",
      "part4": "At the end of 2024, Oro and Lyn founded their organization — the Ouroboros Charitable Foundation. While humanitarian aid remains an important part of their work, the foundation now focuses on long-term needs that are just as urgent: supporting the psychological well-being of people affected by war, maintaining disaster readiness, and providing aid to vulnerable populations.",
      "part5": "Sadly, every part of Ukraine continues to bear the deep trauma of conflict. Ouroboros has several socially vital projects, such as providing safe shelter and relocation for internally displaced people from high-risk areas of the Kherson region, helping people integrate into new communities, and developing initiatives to revitalize local economies."
